# Behind The Name

Ghost was initially going to be called "Adascript," but after much thought decided to not go that route as I didn't want it to be confused with the Ada programming language.

Ghost also isn't solely a scripting language, so that would just add on to the confusion. I also didn't want to introduce another Java/JavaScript type pairing in the world :ghost:

None-the-less, Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing were the two influential people for the concept behind the language. Or At least, the naming aspects of it. The idea was to create a language that would sort of play on history. Having a language called "Adascript" that was Turing complete seemed magical.

### Ada Lovelace

**Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace** was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the **Analytical Engine**. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first *algorithm* intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognize the full potential of a "computing machine" and one of the first computer programmers.

Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the calculating engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simple called *Notes*. These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program â€” that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine.

Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine.

Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.

Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.

### Alan Turing

Alan Mathison Turing was a British mathematician, computer scientist, logican, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the **Turing machine**, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.

During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Betchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.

Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war.

Due to the problems of counterfactual history, it's hard to estimate what effect Ultra intelligence had on the war, but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14 million lives.

Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

In "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", Turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence, and proposed an experiment that became known as the Turing test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called "intelligent".

The idea was that a computer could be said to "think" if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being. In the paper, Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind, it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child's mind and then to subject it to a course of education.

## Ghost

So, given the quandaries of using "Adascript" as a name for this language I'm wanting to create, I had to come up with a new name.

Oh boy.

Naming things is half the battle when it comes to programming (I'm sure you can apply that to other fields as well). I didn't want an abstract name to give it, like a single letter. I didn't want to piggyback off another language's name. I wanted this language to have a personality. A character. Something that could embody it and make it feel alive. Even though programming languages are something completely made up and _intended_ to be generalized, in some sense, they still seem to come out with certain quirks. Some languages play off of this, even if its just at the surface of the language; such as PHP and it's elephant. Others take it a little further, like Go and its Gopher embodiment.

One of the driving factors and themes behind my interest in computers and programming, is artificial intelligence. I definitely knew I wanted to play off of this with the language. So I started thinking: Adam, Atom, Axiom, and then I look up from my desk and see this:

I'm a pretty big Ghost in the Shell fan, so I immediately frantically Google searched if there was another language called "Ghost". Nothing prominently came up.

It plays well with my intial theme of artificial intelligence. It sounds bad-ass. It's simple. It has character. It's perfect.

Say hello to Ghost.
