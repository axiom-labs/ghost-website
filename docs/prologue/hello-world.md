# Hello World
What language is complete without the classic **Hello World** program? Let's see how we can write this in Ghost. You ready?

```ghost
let message = "Hello, world!";

print message;
```

Couldn't be any simpler. Here's the same thing but written in C for comparison.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    char message = "Hello, world!";

    printf("%s", message);

    return 0;
}
```

And in Python.

```python
message = "Hello, world!"

print(message)
```

And in PHP.

```php
<?php

$message = 'Hello, world!';

echo $message;
```
